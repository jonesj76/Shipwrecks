        <h2>An Increase In Ship Wrecks</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our project focuses on an increase in shipwrecks during the 19th century. Our goal is to find out how technological advancements during this time period contributed to these wrecks.We decided to focus on a data spike that occurred between 1820-1890. A span of 70 years where shipwrecks dramatically increased, to explain this, we dove into the surrounding history around these shipwrecks during this period to find any possible outliers or anomalies that inadvertently contributed to this peak in shipwrecks.The overview of our project focuses on the history relating to the evolution of ships during this time period.The rapid advancement in ship technologies initially had a detrimental effect on ship safety causing a disproportionate increase of shipwrecks in the post Civil War United States. These technologies include a change in materials used for constructing ships, design of ships, increasing evolution of composite engines, and increased productions of ships as well. This data is relevant to our argument because using different software technology, we can create data visualizations based on this data set to show the historic evolution and relevance of shipwrecks. How did the advancement in ship design and infrastructure during the 19th century effect the dramatic increase in shipwrecks observed off the New Jersey coast in the second half of the 19th century?</p>
        <p>During the latter half of the 19th century, technological advancements in ship design and composite engine design led to a huge increase in manufacturing and production speed for ships. This led to a major increase in the amount of ships being produced in a much shorter time span leading to possible engine failures or integral failures within the ships due to no safety policies being implemented and being overlooked. Another major factor that played a role in this data spike was the combined effects of the civil war as well as the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution led to a huge increase of manufacturing efforts as an effort to keep up with globalization. This speed increase led to technological advancements exponentially growing around the U.S. as well as a huge increase in the evolution of composite engines being manufactred for various ships. This level of increase led to engine failures due to safety inspections not being in place as well as no form of safety policies being put in place either. The Civil War during this time increased the demand for ships as both armies during this time relied on supplies being delivered for ammunition or food. Special ships called Blockade Runners were designed for this very purpose. Fast and versatile, these ships could traverse ocean waters at around 25 knots, but structurally, weren't very safe. As well as this, these ships would deliver supplies at night and wouldn't run their fog lights to avoid detection from either army. This would create a dangerous environment and led to an increase in shipwrecks due to various blockade runners crashing against rocks because of impaired visibility.</p>
